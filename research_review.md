# Planning Research Review

The sub-field of planning within AI evolved from the pragmatic requirements
of robotics and operations scheduling, and it has undergone several
significant shifts over the years. [1]


## Partial order planning

Prior to the 1970s, planning was done primarily through total order planning.
A planning system would figure out action sequences that would produce each
subgoal, and then would string them together to produce a full solution.
The problem is there were some types of simple plans (like the Sussman anomoly)
that could not be handled by this kind of total ordering. [2]

This prompted the creation of planning systems that could build "task networks",
plans where the real contribution is the idea of proposing necessary tasks
in ways the provide the *least* possible ordering constraints, thus an output
plan describes only strict orderings where one task is dependent on the prior completion
of another, they "partially ordered" plans. [3]

## State Space Planning

Partial order planning still has the problem of dealing with actions that "undo"
pieces of the successful plan already completed.  It can be complicated
to do sufficient back-chaining for complicated states to find a reasonable
path to the goal.  In 1996, the UNPOP paper showed that finding a decent
heuristic and applying normal search processes with it was an improvement
on attempting to chain order-independent sub-plans.

The proposed heuristic used the min count of necessary actions to achieve the goal
from the current state, ignoring any delete effects they use, and then using
conventional search patterns to navigate to a solution. [4]

## Graphplan

A new perspective on planning was advanced in 1995-1997 by the
emergence of GRAPHPLAN.  This is where the encoded representation of a
"planning graph" comes from, and marked a big step forward in terms of efficiency
for generating a reasonable plan for complex domains.

A planning graph, rather than representing the possible state space, uses
a compact representation of all the possible states after each number
of possible actions (each action level has all possible actions at that point,
  each state level has all possible resulting states from the prior actions,
  incompatibilities are stored via mutex lists).

The planning graph itself provides a useful heuristic for estimating the distance
from solution for a given state, but it also is possible to extract a working
plan from the encoding using the GRAPHPLAN algorithm.  The intuition is that
the planning graph is extended to the first level at which the goal fluents
all exists without mutex, and then backward-chaining is initiated from the last
state level, searching for actions that *add* the most goal fluents in the previous
action level (thus resulting in a new state, at the prior level, and a search
  for actions in the prior action level that achieves the most of the *remaining* unaccounted for goal fluents).

This was a major step for the field at the time because the algorithm was
empirically demonstrated to outperform total planning, partial planning, and 'Prodigy'
on state-of-the-art benchmarks. [5]
